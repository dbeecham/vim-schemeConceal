vim-schemeConceal adds conceal functionality to the scheme
programming language. This script also highlights mutable functions
(those that end with a bang).

To disable highlighting mutable functions, set g:no_scheme_highlight_mutable
to true. To disable concealment, set g:no_scheme_conceal to true.

This script was inspired by the vim script vim-haskellConceal
by Vincent Berthoux.
